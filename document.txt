Simple Blog Application with user Authentication 

In this project, I have done a blog application with user authentication. This project is built using the 
Django web framework.

# Features :

* User Authentication: 
   Implemented using Django's built-in authentication system.

* Post CRUD Operations:
   Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on blog posts.

* User Permissions:
   Only authenticated users can perform certain actions, and only the author of a post can modify it.

* Views:
   Utilized function-based views for handling different functionalities.

* Templates:
   Separate HTML templates for each view to maintain code organization.
